# What are the Fundamentals of AI?

While there can be many definitions of the fundamental of artificial intelligence (FOAI), within the EIT CDT, we define three areas that allows a modern, inclusive and diverse interpretation of FOAI.

## Theory and Foundations  

Researchers in this area focus on the foundational mathematical, statistical, and computational principles that underpin AI. This includes research in topics such as learning theory, optimisation, stochastic analysis, complexity theory and formal methods. The aim is to create formal frameworks for the analysis of AI algorithms and systems in order to gain insight into properties, understand behaviours and to develop improved algorithms that could have widespread general use in the field.

## Applied Fundamentals  

At the FOAI CDT, researchers maybe interested in particular applications of AI such as in medicine, climate change or government services. Researchers in this area will examine how the properties of real world data can guide the reformulation of existing AI algorithms or the design of new algorithms entirely. Topics in this area include how to handle missing data, multimodal data integration, decision support, etc. 

## Fundamentals of AI Systems and Engineering  

In recent years, there has been an unprecedent emregence of large and complex AI systems, such as Large Language Models. Researchers in this area are interested in the formal frameworks for characteristing the design and development of such systems and using these to further understand the properties and behaviours of such systems. They may also be interested in the security, scalability and physical resource requirements of such systems.
