# Ellison Institute of Technology Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Oxford (EIT FOAI CDT)

The EIT CDT in Fundamentals of AI based at the University of Oxford is part of a strategic collaboration between the University and the Ellison Institute of Technology. It will support up to 100 doctoral researchers to undertake foundational research in the underpinning theory and methods of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to have a transformative impact on the field of artificial intelligence itself and across a range of humane themes associated with the EIT.

We are dedicated to advancing foundational research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on theoretical underpinnings and methodological innovation. Our mission is to develop AI technologies with the potential to drive transformative impact across key global challenges particularly those aligned with the Ellison Institute of Technology.
