# Ellison Institute of Technology Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Oxford (EIT FOAI CDT)

## About

The EIT CDT in Fundamentals of AI based at the University of Oxford is part of a strategic collaboration between the University and the Ellison Institute of Technology. It will support up to 100 doctoral researchers to undertake foundational research in the underpinning theory and methods of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to have a transformative impact on the field of artificial intelligence itself and across a range of humane themes associated with the EIT.

## What is our mission?

We are dedicated to advancing foundational research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on theoretical underpinnings and methodological innovation. Our mission is to develop AI technologies with the potential to drive transformative impact across key global challenges particularly those aligned with the Ellison Institute of Technology, including (i) Health and Medical Science, (ii) Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture, (iii) Climate Change and Clean Energy and (iv) Government Innovation in the Era of AI.

## What are the Fundamentals of AI?

While there can be many definitions of the fundamental of artificial intelligence (FOAI), within the EIT CDT, we define three areas that allows a modern, inclusive and diverse interpretation of FOAI.

### Theory and Foundations  

Researchers in this area focus on the foundational mathematical, statistical, and computational principles that underpin AI. This includes research in topics such as learning theory, optimisation, stochastic analysis, complexity theory and formal methods. The aim is to create formal frameworks for the analysis of AI algorithms and systems in order to gain insight into properties, understand behaviours and to develop improved algorithms that could have widespread general use in the field.

### Applied Fundamentals  

At the FOAI CDT, researchers maybe interested in particular applications of AI such as in medicine, climate change or government services. Researchers in this area will examine how the properties of real world data can guide the reformulation of existing AI algorithms or the design of new algorithms entirely. Topics in this area include how to handle missing data, multimodal data integration, decision support, etc. 

### Fundamentals of AI Systems and Engineering  

In recent years, there has been an unprecedent emregence of large and complex AI systems, such as Large Language Models. Researchers in this area are interested in the formal frameworks for characteristing the design and development of such systems and using these to further understand the properties and behaviours of such systems. They may also be interested in the security, scalability and physical resource requirements of such systems.

## Who are we looking for?

We are looking to recruit individuals whose research interests are aligned with our mission and whose academic and professional experience to date meet the following specification: 

- **Delivered an outstanding performance in an undergraduate or postgraduate degree in a subject that involves the extensive study of relevant graduate-level mathematics**

We are looking for individuals with an exceptional academic track record and can demonstrate a high level of performance in a subject of study that involves graduate-level mathematical study. This would normally involve successfully completing undergraduate and possibly further postgraduate study in subjects such as mathematics, statistics, engineering, computer science or physics.

- **Have demonstrable experience of artificial intelligence research**

We are looking for individuals to provide evidence of their interest and commitment to artificial intelligence research commensurate with their career stage. This could involve research projects as part of their formal academic studies, internships or professional work experience. 

- **Possess a clear motivation for the study of fundamentals of artificial intelligence**

We want to understand how your career record and experiences to date have led to an interest in the further study of the fundamentals of AI. We want to see a compelling vision for how *this* CDT will support your future aspirations.

- **Demonstrates an understanding of how the fundamentals of artificial intelligence links to real world impact**

While not all FOAI CDT students will have a deep interest in applications of AI and may prefer to focus on theoretical studies only, we want all students to have an appreciation of the link between fundamental AI research and how those outputs can be used in applications. If you are interested in applications, tell us how your interests align with the EIT themes. If not, tell us how you think your theory and methods work could have a range of uses.

- **Provides indicators of emerging leadership capabilities**

We are seeking individuals who can demonstrate the potential to not only undertake great doctoral research but may have the ability to become leaders in their field and beyond. The CDT will develop these skills during the programme but we want candidates who can give examples where they have demonstrated strong communication skills, the ability to engage and work with others, or taken the initiative and responsibility. Evidence could be in the context of academic or professional work but can also be shown through personal interests, sports and hobbies (e.g. charity work).

## Course Programme

The FOAI CDT implements a four year doctoral programme in a 1+3 format. The first year involves participation in a number of taught study modules covering a range of EIT and FOAI topics. At the end of the first year, the students will propose a research project to be carried out in Years 2-4 of their studies.

### First Year Modules

The first year will involve eight study modules delivered during the first two terms. These will include:

1. **Fundamentals of AI** - this introductory module will provide a rapid overview of the current state of the art topics in artificial intelligence and linking these to fundamental unresolved questions. This module will enable FOAI CDT students to gain an overview of the breadth and depth of AI research at Oxford and also at the EIT. It will challenge them to consider AI research areas that they may not have considered before.

2. **EIT Theme: Health & Medical Sciences** - this application-focused module will explore the applications of AI in the health and medical sciences from molecular to population-based research. The module will provide an introduction to formal methods of experimental design and observational study analysis and link these to the development of AI methods for high-dimensional structured data modelling, time-to-event analysis, causal methods as well as ethics and regulation.
 
4. **EIT Theme: Food security and Sustainable Agriculture / Climate change and clean energy**
5. **EIT Theme: Government innovation in the era of AI**
