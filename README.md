# Ellison Institute of Technology Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Oxford (EIT FOAI CDT)

## About

The EIT CDT in Fundamentals of AI will support up to 100 doctoral researchers to undertake foundational research in the underpinning theory and methods of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to have a transformative impact on the field of artificial intelligence itself and across a range of humane themes associated with the EIT. EIT themes range across: health and medical science; food security and sustainable agriculture; climate change and clean energy; and government innovation in the era of AI.

## What are the Fundamentals of AI?

While there can be many definitions of the fundamental of artificial intelligence (FOAI), within the EIT CDT, we define three areas that allows a modern, inclusive and diverse interpretation of FOAI.

### Theory and Foundations  

Researchers in this area focus on the foundational mathematical, statistical, and computational principles that underpin AI. This includes research in topics such as learning theory, optimisation, stochastic analysis, complexity theory and formal methods. The aim is to create formal frameworks for the analysis of AI algorithms and systems in order to gain insight into properties, understand behaviours and to develop improved algorithms that could have widespread general use in the field.

### Applied Fundamentals  

At the FOAI CDT, researchers maybe interested in particular applications of AI such as in medicine, climate change or government services. Researchers in this area will examine how the properties of real world data can guide the reformulation of existing AI algorithms or the design of new algorithms entirely. Topics in this area include how to handle missing data, multimodal data integration, decision support, etc. 

### Fundamentals of AI Systems and Engineering  

In recent years, there has been an unprecedent emregence of large and complex AI systems, such as Large Language Models. Researchers in this area are interested in the formal frameworks for characteristing the design and development of such systems and using these to further understand the properties and behaviours of such systems. They may also be interested in the security, scalability and physical resource requirements of such systems.

## Course Programme

The FOAI CDT implements a four year doctoral programme in a 1+3 format. The first year involves participation in a number of taught study modules covering a range of EIT and FOAI topics. At the end of the first year, the students will propose a research project to be carried out in Years 2-4 of their studies.

### First Year Modules

The first year will involve eight study modules delivered during the first two terms. These will include:

1. **Fundamentals of AI** - this introductory module will provide a rapid overview of the current state of the art topics in artificial intelligence and linking these to fundamental unresolved questions. This module will enable FOAI CDT students to gain an overview of the breadth and depth of AI research at Oxford and also at the EIT. It will challenge them to consider AI research areas that they may not have considered before.

2. **EIT Theme: Health & Medical Sciences** - this application-focused module will explore the applications of AI in the health and medical sciences from molecular to population-based research. The module will provide an introduction to formal methods of experimental design and observational study analysis and link these to the development of AI methods for high-dimensional structured data modelling, time-to-event analysis, causal methods as well as ethics and regulation.
 
4. **EIT Theme: Food security and Sustainable Agriculture / Climate change and clean energy**
5. **EIT Theme: Government innovation in the era of AI**
