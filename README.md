# Ellison Institute of Technology Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Oxford (EIT FOAI CDT)

## About

The EIT CDT in Fundamentals of AI based at the University of Oxford is part of a strategic collaboration between the University and the Ellison Institute of Technology. It will support up to 100 doctoral researchers to undertake foundational research in the underpinning theory and methods of Artificial Intelligence that have the potential to have a transformative impact on the field of artificial intelligence itself and across a range of humane themes associated with the EIT.

## What is our mission?

We are dedicated to advancing foundational research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on theoretical underpinnings and methodological innovation. Our mission is to develop AI technologies with the potential to drive transformative impact across key global challenges particularly those aligned with the Ellison Institute of Technology.

## Who are we looking for?

We are looking to recruit individuals whose research interests are aligned with our mission and whose academic and professional experience to date meet the following specification: 

- **Delivered an outstanding performance in an undergraduate or postgraduate degree in a subject that involves the extensive study of relevant graduate-level mathematics**

We are looking for individuals with an exceptional academic track record and can demonstrate a high level of performance in a subject of study that involves graduate-level mathematical study. This would normally involve successfully completing undergraduate and possibly further postgraduate study in subjects such as mathematics, statistics, engineering, computer science or physics.

- **Have demonstrable experience of artificial intelligence research**

We are looking for individuals to provide evidence of their interest and commitment to artificial intelligence research commensurate with their career stage. This could involve research projects as part of their formal academic studies, internships or professional work experience. 

- **Possess a clear motivation for the study of fundamentals of artificial intelligence**

We want to understand how your career record and experiences to date have led to an interest in the further study of the fundamentals of AI. We want to see a compelling vision for how *this* CDT will support your future aspirations.

- **Demonstrates an understanding of how the fundamentals of artificial intelligence links to real world impact**

While not all FOAI CDT students will have a deep interest in applications of AI and may prefer to focus on theoretical studies only, we want all students to have an appreciation of the link between fundamental AI research and how those outputs can be used in applications. If you are interested in applications, tell us how your interests align with the EIT themes. If not, tell us how you think your theory and methods work could have a range of uses.

- **Provides indicators of emerging leadership capabilities**

We are seeking individuals who can demonstrate the potential to not only undertake great doctoral research but may have the ability to become leaders in their field and beyond. The CDT will develop these skills during the programme but we want candidates who can give examples where they have demonstrated strong communication skills, the ability to engage and work with others, or taken the initiative and responsibility. Evidence could be in the context of academic or professional work but can also be shown through personal interests, sports and hobbies (e.g. charity work).

## Course Programme

The FOAI CDT implements a four year doctoral programme in a 1+3 format. The first year involves participation in a number of taught study modules covering a range of EIT and FOAI topics. At the end of the first year, the students will propose a research project to be carried out in Years 2-4 of their studies.
