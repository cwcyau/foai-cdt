## 🌟 Welcome

The EIT CDT in Fundamentals of AI will undertake foundational research in the underpinning theory and method development of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning that have the potential to have a transformative impact across a range of humane themes associated with the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT). EIT themes range across: health and medical science; food security and sustainable agriculture; climate change and clean energy; and government innovation in the era of AI.

The programme will provide students with training in both cutting-edge AI research methodologies and the development of business and transferable skills. Students will undertake a significant, challenging and original research project, leading to the award of a DPhil (PhD).

Key topics and themes will focus on fundamentals of artificial intelligence, computational statistics and machine learning, reflecting the breadth and depth of the research experience of the supervisory pool
