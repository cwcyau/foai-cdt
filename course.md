### [Fundamentals of AI 1](modules/foai-1.md) (Weeks 4-5, Michaelmas)

This is a two week module designed to provide a rapid introduction to key or under-studied topics in artificial intelligence. 

### [Fundamentals of AI 2](modules/foai-1.md) (Weeks 6-7, Michaelmas)

This is a two week module designed to provide a rapid introduction to key or under-studied topics in artificial intelligence. 

### Emerging AI (Weekly sessions, Hilary)

A series of tutorials and seminars predominantly given by Oxford academics on specialist AI topics. These will be an opportunity for students to meet potential DPhil supervisors.

### AI Skills (Weekly sessions, Hilary)

A series of tutorials and seminars predominantly given by EIT and Oxford academics on specialist AI skills topics. Examples topics to include:

- Multi-GPU programming considerations
- MLOps
- Data Engineering
- Ethics
- Regulation
- Publishing

### [Group Projects](group-projects/group-projects.md) (Part-time Michaelmas, Full-time Hilary, Part-time Trinity)

Students will participate in year-long group projects. Part-time in Autumn and Summer terms and full-time in the Spring term.

### Individual Rotation Projects (Full-time Trinity, Full-time Summer)

Students will select or devise two rotation project options (which will last 10-12 weeks). These will be undertaken during the Summer period after Easter until September.
