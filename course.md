# Course Programme

The FoAI CDT implements a four year doctoral programme in a 1+3 type format.

## First Year

In the first year student undertake the following programmed activities: 

### Software Engineering

This is a two-week module designed to provide an introduction to modern software engineering concepts including programming principles, code testing and high-performance computing environments. This is a shared course with other programmes within the wider [Doctoral Training Centre](https://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/).
