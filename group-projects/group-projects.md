# Group Projects (2025/26)

## About

Modern AI research is fast-paced and ever-changing. This means that traditional methods of teaching such as through lecture courses or the use of textbooks are rarely applicable. The aim of the group projects is to enable learning through supported research and practice.

In teams of 3-4, you will tackle a designated problem. Prior familiarity of the problem is not necessary and we *encourage* you to be part of a team which is looking at something that you have not encountered before - this is about *learning*.

Group projects will run throughout the year with varying levels of time commitment. You will be supported by the CDT Directors and project-specific mentors including from EIT. 

In Michaelmas term, you will focus on background reading and preparation. You will engage with project mentors to understand the broader context of your problem and the specific literature and background theory to review. Much of this will be done via private study as you will be doing this alongside the core modules. However, there will allocated time for regular touch points with mentors. By the end of the term, the aim is to have a solid knowledge base for the next stage of work.

In Hilary term, the group projects will
