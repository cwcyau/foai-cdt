# Title

Multiscale Foundation Models

## Challenge

Many domains (genes in DNA, chapters in books) exhibit long-scale hierarchical dependencies that are poorly captured by existing autoregressive foundational models.

## Description

Develop and evaluate hierarchical or multiscale masked autoencoder (MAE) architectures for learning rich representations from large biomolecular datasets (e.g., genomics, proteomics), focusing on capturing long-range dependencies and functional motifs.

## Skills Required

Deep learning, sequence modelling, MAEs 

## Skills to be Developed

Multiscale model design, application to biological data
