## Individual Research Proposal

**Academic Supervisor(s)**

Your proposal must be supported by at least one member of academic staff who is committed to acting as your primary academic supervisor during your research and has a contract of employment with the university that extends beyond your expected DPhil completion date. Depending on the host department and divisional requirements, you may also require additional supervisors.

**External Supervisor(s)**

List any non-university collaborators who will have a former role in your supervision and delivery of your research. This includeds EIT-based researchers.

**Host Department**

The host department is normally the department that your proposed primary supervisor is based in. The department and the university division in which the host department resides in will also dictate the general arrangements (e.g. requirements for DPhil progression) for the reminder of your DPhil.

**Proposal Title**

The title of your research proposal.

**Plain English Summary (up to 250 words)**

The plain English summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are considering (and why it is a problem)
- How you propose to tackle that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before

[ ] Please tick this box to indicate if you have used a Large Language Model to produce this lay summary. Use of LLMs to support the production of the lay summary is permitted but you should carefully review the output to ensure that it describes the technical description of the proposal.

**Background (up to 400 words excluding references)** (do not complete if this is part of a coordinated proposal)

Describe the general background to the problem that you are proposing to address:

- What is the problem?
- What attempts have been made to solve the problem and how?
- Why it remains a challenge?
- If the research is linked to an application, describe the real-world benefits that a solution to problem could bring.

**Proposed research (up to 800 words)**

- Describe the main activities in the first 9-12 months
- Describe the proposed follow-up activities in the next two years of your research
- You should outline the approaches to developing solutions and the theories and methodologies to be used
- You should be explicit about the fundamental AI question you will address
- Describe the roles of any collaborators in the proposed work
  
**Resources required to support this work (up to 400 words)**

*Compute resources* - describe any significant computational resources that maybe required for this work that may go beyond typical university provisions.

*Data sets* - describe any large or restricted access data sets that you may require and plans for obtaining these and managing these.

*EIT* - describe any plans to be based at the EIT during your research including resources that would be used and requirements for building access and workspace.

*Other (e.g. ethical review, additional financial support, extended visits with collaborators)* - describe any other resources that you may require to complete this work for which you may require additional support. 

Note 1: the CDT will carefully consider additional support but students should not propose research projects which would wholly be non-viable without these extra resources being made available. Students and supervisors should avoid developing research proposals that require excessive additional support. Priority will be given to requests that involve collaboration with EIT.

Note 2: If this individual proposal is part of an coordinated proposal, please only indicate the additional resources required for your contribution only.
