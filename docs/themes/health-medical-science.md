## The Pathogen Program

The recent pandemic demonstrated the need for an international system for identifying and sequencing new and evolving pathogens, to characterise and monitor emerging threats, such as antimicrobial resistance. The Pathogen Program is developing end-to-end solutions for diagnosing infectious diseases, detecting antimicrobial resistance and preventing outbreaks from escalating into pandemics.

EIT Pathogena is building bioinformatics pipelines that address a broad spectrum of pathogens. Our solutions empower laboratories, academia, and public health organisations around the globe, helping them to respond more quickly and effectively to infectious disease threats. By leveraging innovation, collaboration, and data-driven insights, EIT Pathogena is transforming pathogen genomics and shaping the future of global public health.

Our mission is to develop innovative metagenomic analysis tools, with the ultimate aim of creating an ‘always-on’ global pathogen surveillance system capable of identifying emerging threats and providing early warnings of disease outbreaks before they escalate.

## AI Based Population Scale Predictive and Pre-emptive Health System

Use AI to predict disease before the emergence of symptoms, by analysing population scale electronic health data. This will enable early prevention strategies, reduce human suffering, and lower the cost of treating disease.

## Cloud Based Global Clinical Trials and Real World Evidence System

Develop a cloud-based application and a global network of IoT diagnostic and monitoring devices that will substantially reduce the time and cost of testing and approving new drugs, therapeutics and technologies, and enable continued monitoring of patient outcomes after regulatory approval.

## Healthy Ageing, Mechanisms and Interventions

Understanding the biological basis of aging and develop intervention for healthier living and life extension.
