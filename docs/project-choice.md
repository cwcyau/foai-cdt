# DPhil research proposal

## Introduction

At the FoAI CDT we would like to actively encourage the development of early-stage research independence amongst our students. This means offering students the chance to develop their own research proposal to be undertaken in Years 2-4 of the programme and to engage in an iterative process of constructive, critical assessment to improved and refine the proposal in order to arrive at a final programme of research.

## What makes a good proposal?

As the Fundamentals of AI CDT, we are 

## How will my proposal be assessed?

Individual Research Proposal

An individual research proposal describes activities that will be undertaken by a single student only under the guidance of a university supervisor.

Coordinated Research Proposal

A coordinated research proposals describes a series of interconnected activities that will be undertaken by two or more students. Coordinated research proposals must be sponsored by an EIT researcher.

## The proposal

**Academic Supervisor(s)**

Your proposal must be supported by one permanent member of academic staff who is committed to acting as your academic supervisor during your research. 

**Host Department**

The host department is normally the department that your proposed primary supervisor is based in. The department and the university division in which the host department resides in will also dictate the general arrangements (e.g. requirements for DPhil progression) for the reminder of your DPhil.

**Lay Summary (up to 250 words)**

The lay summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are advising (and why it is a problem)
- How you are considering tackling that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before
