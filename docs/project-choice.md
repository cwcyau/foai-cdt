# DPhil research proposal

## Introduction

At the FoAI CDT we would like to actively encourage the development of early-stage research independence amongst our students. 

This means we are offering students the chance to develop their own research proposal to be undertaken in Years 2-4 of the programme and to engage in an iterative process of constructive, critical assessment to improved and refine the proposal in order to arrive at a final programme of research. 

We would also like to offer students to form teams and develop *coordinated research projects* with the EIT. These will be a series of interconnected research activities that will be undertaken by two or more students centred around a central large-scale research problem. We anticipate coordinated research projects will involve access to significant resources (e.g. data and compute, experimental follow-up, etc) where the scale and cost of the provision of such resouces cannot be justified for a single research student only.

## Individual vs Coordinated Proposals?

We want students to choose the best option that is most compatible with their personal research interests, how they want to work and fits with their future ambitions. For some students, the traditional individual research proposal will be the ideal option as it gives maximum independence and freedom. Others may be more attracted to working with others in teams and the collaborative opportunities with EIT. Ultimately, every student will have to make a substantive *individual* research contribution for the award of the DPhil degree.

The EIT will be interested in supporting individual and coordinated proposals but capacity limitations means priority maybe given to coordinated proposals.

## What makes a good proposal?

- All research proposal should contain one or more activities which involve addressing a non-trivial fundamental AI question. This could involve theoretical or methodological development.

- Fundamental AI research does not need to constitute the majority of the proposed research. 

- The proposal should provide a clear description of the first 9-12 months of research activity (i.e. up to Transfer of Status).

- The proposal should provide a broader vision for the remaining parts of your DPhil.

- We encourage proposals that involve collaboration with EIT.

*For coordinated proposal*

- A clear description of why the proposed series of research activities are focused around a central ambition.

- An explanation of why the coordination is needed and why the research cannot wholly be completed by an individual.

- Defines sufficient work for every team member to be able to develop their own standalone DPhil thesis.
 
## Do you have a template for the proposal documentation?

[Individual Research Proposal](individal_proposal.md)

An individual research proposal describes activities that will be undertaken by a single student only under the guidance of a university supervisor.

[Coordinated Research Proposal](coordinated_proposal.md)

A coordinated research proposals describes a series of interconnected activities that will be undertaken by two or more students. Coordinated research proposals must be sponsored by an EIT researcher.
