# DPhil research proposal

## Introduction

At the FoAI CDT we would like to actively encourage the development of early-stage research independence amongst our students. This means offering students the chance to develop their own research proposal to be undertaken in Years 2-4 of the programme and to engage in an iterative process of constructive, critical assessment to improved and refine the proposal in order to arrive at a final programme of research. We would also like to offer students to form groups and develop *coordinated research projects* with the EIT, a series of interconnected research activities that will be undertaken by or more students, but centred around a central research problem.

## What makes a good proposal?

- All research proposal should contain one or more activities which involve addressing a non-trivial fundamental AI question. This could involve theoretical or methodological development.

- Fundamental AI research does not need to constitute the majority of the proposed research. 

- The proposal should provide a clear description of the first 9-12 months of research activity (i.e. up to Transfer of Status).

- The proposal should provide a broader vision for the remaining parts of your DPhil.

- We encourage proposals that involve collaboration with EIT.

## How will my proposal be assessed?

[Individual Research Proposal](individal_proposal.md)

An individual research proposal describes activities that will be undertaken by a single student only under the guidance of a university supervisor.

[Coordinated Research Proposal](coordinated_proposal.md)

A coordinated research proposals describes a series of interconnected activities that will be undertaken by two or more students. Coordinated research proposals must be sponsored by an EIT researcher.

## Individual Research Proposal

**Academic Supervisor(s)**

Your proposal must be supported by at least one permanent member of academic staff who is committed to acting as your primary academic supervisor during your research. Depending on the host department and divisional requirements, you may require additional supervisors.

**External Supervisor(s)**

List any non-university collaborators who will have a former role in your supervision. This includeds EIT-based researchers.

**Host Department**

The host department is normally the department that your proposed primary supervisor is based in. The department and the university division in which the host department resides in will also dictate the general arrangements (e.g. requirements for DPhil progression) for the reminder of your DPhil.

**Proposal Title**

The title of your research proposal.

**Plain English Summary (up to 250 words)**

The plain English summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are considering (and why it is a problem)
- How you propose to tackle that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before

[ ] Please tick this box to indicate if you have used a Large Language Model to produce this lay summary. Use of LLMs to support the production of the lay summary is permitted but you should carefully review the output to ensure that it describes the technical description of the proposal.

**Background (up to 400 words excluding references)**

Describe the general background to the problem that you are proposing to address:

- What is the problem?
- What attempts have been made to solve the problem and how?
- Why it remains a challenge?
- If the research is linked to an application, describe the real-world benefits that a solution to problem could bring.

**Proposed research (up to 800 words)**

- Describe the main activities in the first 9-12 months
- Describe the proposed follow-up activities in the next two years of your research
- You should outline the approaches to developing solutions and the theories and methodologies to be used
- You should be explicit about the fundamental AI question you will address
  
**Resources required to support this work (up to 400 words)**

*Compute resources* - describe any significant computational resources that maybe required for this work that may go beyond typical university provisions.

*Data sets* - describe any large or restricted access data sets that you may require and plans for obtaining these and managing these.

*Other (e.g. ethical review, additional financial support, extended visits with collaborators)* - describe any other resources that you may require to complete this work for which you may require additional support. 

Note - the CDT will carefully consider additional support but students should not propose research projects which would wholly be non-viable without these extra resources being made available. Students and supervisors should avoid developing research proposals that require excessive additional support. Priority will be given to requests that involve collaboration with EIT.

## Coordinated Research Proposal

**Proposal Title**

The title of the research proposal.

[ ] Tick this box if this is a pre-existing coordinated project that you are proposing join 

**Team members and Academic Supervisor(s)**

For new teams, list the participating students. 

If joining an existing team, list the proposed addition members.

**Academic Supervisor(s)**

Your proposal must be supported by one permanent member of academic staff who is committed to acting as your academic supervisor during your research. 

**Host Department**

The host department is normally the department that your proposed primary supervisor is based in. The department and the university division in which the host department resides in will also dictate the general arrangements (e.g. requirements for DPhil progression) for the reminder of your DPhil.

Each participating student must also complete an individual research proposal whose details will describe their proposed personal contribution.
