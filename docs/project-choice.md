# DPhil research proposal

## Introduction

At the FoAI CDT we would like to actively encourage the development of early-stage research independence amongst our students. 

This means we are offering students the chance to develop their own research proposal to be undertaken in Years 2-4 of the programme and to engage in an iterative process of constructive, critical assessment to improved and refine the proposal in order to arrive at a final programme of research. 

We would also like to offer students to form teams and develop *coordinated research projects* with the EIT. These will be a series of interconnected research activities that will be undertaken by two or more students centred around a central large-scale research problem. We anticipate coordinated research projects will involve access to significant resources (e.g. data and compute, experimental follow-up, etc) where the scale and cost of the provision of such resouces cannot be justified for a single research student only.

## Individual vs Group Proposals?

We want students to choose the best option that is most compatible with their personal research interests, how they want to work and fits with their future ambitions. For some, the traditional individual research proposal will be the ideal option as it gives maximum independence and freedom. Others may be more attracted to working with others in teams.

The EIT will be interested in supporting individual and coordinated proposals but capacity limitations means priority maybe given to coordinated proposals.

## What makes a good proposal?

- All research proposal should contain one or more activities which involve addressing a non-trivial fundamental AI question. This could involve theoretical or methodological development.

- Fundamental AI research does not need to constitute the majority of the proposed research. 

- The proposal should provide a clear description of the first 9-12 months of research activity (i.e. up to Transfer of Status).

- The proposal should provide a broader vision for the remaining parts of your DPhil.

- We encourage proposals that involve collaboration with EIT.

*For coordinated proposal*

- A clear description of why the proposed series of research activities are focused around a central ambition.

- An explanation of why the coordination is needed and why the research cannot wholly be completed by an individual.

- Defines sufficient work for every team member to be able to develop their own standalone DPhil thesis.
 

## Do you have a template for the proposal?

[Individual Research Proposal](individal_proposal.md)

An individual research proposal describes activities that will be undertaken by a single student only under the guidance of a university supervisor.

[Coordinated Research Proposal](coordinated_proposal.md)

A coordinated research proposals describes a series of interconnected activities that will be undertaken by two or more students. Coordinated research proposals must be sponsored by an EIT researcher.

## Individual Research Proposal

**Academic Supervisor(s)**

Your proposal must be supported by at least one member of academic staff who is committed to acting as your primary academic supervisor during your research and has a contract of employment with the university that extends beyond your expected DPhil completion date. Depending on the host department and divisional requirements, you may also require additional supervisors.

**External Supervisor(s)**

List any non-university collaborators who will have a former role in your supervision and delivery of your research. This includeds EIT-based researchers.

**Host Department**

The host department is normally the department that your proposed primary supervisor is based in. The department and the university division in which the host department resides in will also dictate the general arrangements (e.g. requirements for DPhil progression) for the reminder of your DPhil.

**Proposal Title**

The title of your research proposal.

**Plain English Summary (up to 250 words)**

The plain English summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are considering (and why it is a problem)
- How you propose to tackle that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before

[ ] Please tick this box to indicate if you have used a Large Language Model to produce this lay summary. Use of LLMs to support the production of the lay summary is permitted but you should carefully review the output to ensure that it describes the technical description of the proposal.

**Background (up to 400 words excluding references)** (do not complete if this is part of a coordinated proposal)

Describe the general background to the problem that you are proposing to address:

- What is the problem?
- What attempts have been made to solve the problem and how?
- Why it remains a challenge?
- If the research is linked to an application, describe the real-world benefits that a solution to problem could bring.

**Proposed research (up to 800 words)**

- Describe the main activities in the first 9-12 months
- Describe the proposed follow-up activities in the next two years of your research
- You should outline the approaches to developing solutions and the theories and methodologies to be used
- You should be explicit about the fundamental AI question you will address
- Describe the roles of any collaborators in the proposed work
  
**Resources required to support this work (up to 400 words)**

*Compute resources* - describe any significant computational resources that maybe required for this work that may go beyond typical university provisions.

*Data sets* - describe any large or restricted access data sets that you may require and plans for obtaining these and managing these.

*EIT* - describe any plans to be based at the EIT during your research including resources that would be used and requirements for building access and workspace.

*Other (e.g. ethical review, additional financial support, extended visits with collaborators)* - describe any other resources that you may require to complete this work for which you may require additional support. 

Note 1: the CDT will carefully consider additional support but students should not propose research projects which would wholly be non-viable without these extra resources being made available. Students and supervisors should avoid developing research proposals that require excessive additional support. Priority will be given to requests that involve collaboration with EIT.

Note 2: If this individual proposal is part of an coordinated proposal, please only indicate the additional resources required for your contribution only.

## Coordinated Research Proposal

Teams interested in proposing a coordinated research proposal should complete the following group application. Each team member should also complete an individual research proposal which describes their personal contribution to the proposed coordinated research.

**Proposal Title**

The title of the research proposal.

[ ] Tick this box if this is a pre-existing coordinated project that you are proposing join 

**Team members**

For new teams, list the participating students. 

If joining an existing team, list the proposed addition members.

**EIT Sponsor**

Name the EIT researcher which is sponsoring this proposal.

**Plain English Summary (up to 400 words)**

The plain English summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are considering (and why it is a problem)
- How you propose to tackle that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before
- Why does it need to be addressed by a team?

**Background (up to 400 words excluding references)**

*This section can be written jointly by all team members*

Describe the general background to the problem that you are proposing to address:

- What is the problem?
- What attempts have been made to solve the problem and how?
- Why it remains a challenge?
- If the research is linked to an application, describe the real-world benefits that a solution to problem could bring.
- Why does the problem need to be addressed by a team?

**Proposed research (up to 400 words)**

- Describe the broad vision for the coordinated group proposal and how you will address the problem defined.
- Briefly describe the activities that will be undertaken and how these are connected. 
- Explain who will be responsible for each contributing activity.
  
**Resources required to support this work (up to 400 words)**

*Compute resources* - describe any significant computational resources that maybe required for this work that may go beyond typical university provisions.
