# Coordinated Research Proposal

Teams interested in proposing a coordinated research proposal should complete the following coordinated research application. 

Each team member must also complete an individual research proposal which describes their personal contribution to the proposed coordinated research.

**Proposal Title**

The title of the research proposal.

[ ] Tick this box if this is a pre-existing coordinated project that you are proposing join 

**Team members**

For new teams, list the participating students. 

If joining an existing team, list the proposed addition members.

**EIT Sponsor**

Name the EIT researcher which is sponsoring this proposal.

**Plain English Summary (up to 400 words)**

The plain English summary should describe your proposed research to a non-expert audience. It should explain:

- The context of the problem you are addressing
- The problem you are considering (and why it is a problem)
- How you propose to tackle that problem
- What would the solution enable that could not be done before
- Why does it need to be addressed by a team?

[ ] Please tick this box to indicate if you have used a Large Language Model to produce this lay summary. Use of LLMs to support the production of the lay summary is permitted but you should carefully review the output to ensure that it describes the technical description of the proposal.

**Background (up to 400 words excluding references)**

*This section can be written jointly by all team members*

Describe the general background to the problem that you are proposing to address:

- What is the problem?
- What attempts have been made to solve the problem and how?
- Why it remains a challenge?
- If the research is linked to an application, describe the real-world benefits that a solution to problem could bring.
- Why does the problem need to be addressed by a team?

**Proposed research (up to 400 words)**

- Describe the broad vision for the coordinated group proposal and how you will address the problem defined.
- Briefly describe the activities that will be undertaken and how these are connected. 
- Explain who will be responsible for each contributing activity.
  
**Resources required to support this work (up to 400 words)**

*Compute resources* - describe any significant computational resources that maybe required for this work that may go beyond typical university provisions.

*Data sets* - describe any large or restricted access data sets that you may require and plans for obtaining these and managing these.

*Other (e.g. ethical review, additional financial support, extended visits with collaborators)* - describe any other resources that you may require to complete this work for which you may require additional support. 

Note - the CDT will carefully consider additional support but students should not propose research projects which would wholly be non-viable without these extra resources being made available.
